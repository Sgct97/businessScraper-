# Polished Cold Calling Script for EarlyBird AI

This script is designed to be a guide, not a rigid text. Adapt it to your natural speaking style. The primary goal is to qualify interest and schedule a follow-up meeting, not to sell on the first call.

---

### **Part 1: The Opening**

*(When the phone is answered, a gatekeeper or decision-maker)*

**You:** "Hi there, my name is Spenser with EarlyBird AI! I have a quick business question to ask, who would be the best person to speak with regarding new technology or operational efficiency?"

---

### **Part 2: Navigating the Gatekeeper**

**If they ask "What is this about?":**
*   **You:** "My company helps local businesses integrate simple AI tools to solve common problems and save time. I just have a quick question for the right person to see if it's even relevant for you."

**If they confirm you are NOT talking to the decision-maker:**
*   **You:** "Okay, no worries, I understand. Would you mind telling me the name of the best contact and when they are usually around so I can call back?"

**If they won't give you a name/time (use this as a last resort):**
*   **You:** "Okay, no problem. Could I get your name and send a quick email with my contact info that you could forward to them?" *(This is slightly more proactive than asking them to take your info down)*

### **Part 3: Engaging the Decision Maker**

*(Once you are speaking with the correct person)*

**You:** "Hi [Name], thanks for taking the call. My name is Spenser with EarlyBird AI. I run a local business that helps other businesses integrate AI into their workflows to solve pain points and get repetitive tasks done more efficiently."

**The Key Qualifying Question:**
*   **You:** "My question is simple: Is your business currently exploring ways to use AI, or are you open to hearing about how it could help?"

---

### **Part 4: The Conversation Paths**

**Path A: They ARE interested or open to hearing more ("Yes")**

*   **You:** "That's great! Many businesses in your industry are finding it gives them a competitive edge. To see if it's a fit for you, would you mind sharing one or two of the biggest pain points or time-consuming tasks in your workflow? I can then tell you if and how we can help."

    *(While they are talking: take notes, reference your cheat sheet.)*

*   **After they share:** "Thank you for sharing that. You mentioned **[repeat back one specific pain point they named]** â€“ that's actually a perfect use-case for what we do. For example, we could set up a system to **[briefly describe the specific solution for that one point].**"

*   **The Close:** "It sounds like this is worth a proper conversation. I'd be happy to schedule a quick 15-minute call or virtual meeting to show you a few examples. Would tomorrow afternoon or Thursday morning work better for you?"

**Path B: They do NOT know about AI / are hesitant**

*   **You:** "No problem at all, I completely understand. Let me ask you a different way: If you could wave a magic wand and fix one or two things in your business that are a major headache or waste of time, what would they be?"

*   **If they give you a pain point:** "Thank you for sharing that. That's actually a problem where AI can be surprisingly effective. For example, we can **[briefly state the solution]**. Look, I'd be happy to schedule a quick 15-minute meeting to show you what I mean. No pressure, no commitment. Would next Tuesday or Thursday work?"

**Path C: They are NOT interested (Firm "No")**

*   **You:** "I completely understand and I appreciate you giving me a moment. Thanks for your time and have a great day."
